//! A simple but robust input-action manager for Bevy: intended to be useful both as a plugin and a helpful library.
//!
//! Inputs from various input sources (keyboard, mouse and gamepad) are collected into a common `ActionState` on your player entity,
//! which can be conveniently used in your game logic.
//!
//! The mapping between inputs and actions is many-to-many, and easily configured and extended with the `InputMap` components on your player entity.
//! A single action can be triggered by multiple inputs (or set directly by UI elements or gameplay logic),
//! and a single input can result in multiple actions being triggered, which can be handled contextually.
//!
//! This library seamlessly supports both single-player and local multiplayer games!
//! Simply add the `InputManagerBundle` to each controllable entity, and customize the `InputMap` appropriately.
//!
//! Of particular note: this plugin allows users to configure which state (i.e. `GameState::Playing`) it runs in.
//! No more characters wandering around while your menu is open!
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Full keyboard, mouse and joystick support for button-like inputs.
//! - Effortlessly wire UI buttons to game state with one simple component!
//!   - When clicked, your button will send a virtual button press to the corresponding entity.
//! - Store all your input mappings in a single `InputMap` component
//!   - No more bespoke `Keybindings<KeyCode>`, `Keybindings<Gamepad>` headaches
//! - Look up your current input state in a single `ActionState` component
//!   - Easily check player statistics while reading input
//!   - That pesky maximum of 16 system parameters got you down? Say goodbye to that input handling mega-system
//! - Ergonomic insertion API that seamlessly blends multiple input types for you
//!   - `input_map.insert(Action::Jump, KeyCode::Space)` XOR `input_map.insert(Action::Jump, C)`? Why not both?
//! - Full support for arbitrary button combinations: chord your heart out.
//!   - `input_map.insert_chord(Action::Console, [KeyCode::LCtrl, KeyCode::Shift, KeyCode::C])`
//! - Create an arbitrary number of strongly typed disjoint action sets: decouple your camera and player state.
//! - Local multiplayer support: freely bind keys to distinct entities, rather than worrying about singular global state
//! - Leafwing Studio's trademark `#![forbid(missing_docs)]`
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! - The `Button` enum only includes `KeyCode`, `MouseButton` and `GamepadButtonType`.
//!   - This is due to object-safety limitations on the types stored in `bevy::input::Input`
//!   - Please file an issue if you would like something more exotic!
//! - No built-in support for non-button input types (e.g. gestures or analog sticks).
//!   - All methods on `ActionState` are `pub`: it's designed to be hooked into and extended.
//! - Gamepads must be associated with each player by the app using this plugin: read from the `Gamepads` resource and use `InputMap::set_gamepad`.
